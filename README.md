## Installation 

> **READ ALL**

This is mainly intended for a clean installation. If you already have a desktop configuration, you should implement it manually instead.

Should work for Arch, Manjaro, EndeavourOS, CachyOS, etc. Let me know if there's any issues

> **First install git then clone the repository and run the installer:**

```bash

sudo pacman -S git   
```
```bash

git clone https://github.com/43PR/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

> **After the installation finishes log out and back in.**

Existing configuration files that are being replaced will be backed up automatically.

Edit default programs in "config/hypr/hyprland.lua".

Any issues with the wallpaper picker just delete cache pictures ".cache/quickshell/thumbs/"
